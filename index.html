                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a
                    document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes
                    how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to
                    W3C specifications. Previously, development of various parts of CSS specification was done
                    synchronously, which allowed versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about
                    CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3. However, CSS4 has never become an official version.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From CSS3, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS
                    modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release
                    recommendations separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now
                    periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS specification.

                    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
                </header>
                <p>Before starting this module, you should have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Basic familiarity with using computers, and using the Web passively (i.e. looking at it,
                        consuming the content.)</li>
                    <li>A basic work environment set up as detailed in Installing basic software, and an understanding
                        of how to create and manage files, as detailed in Dealing with files.</li>
                    <li>Basic familiarity with HTML, as discussed in the Introduction to HTML module.</li>
                    <li>You should learn the basics of HTML before attempting any CSS. We recommend that you work
                        through our Introduction to HTML module first.</li>
                    <li>CSS, starting with the Introduction to CSS module</li>
                    <li>More advanced HTML modules</li>
                    <li>Javascript, and how to use it to add dynamic functionality to web pages</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Once you understand the fundamentals of HTML, we recommend that you learn further HTML and CSS at
                    the same time, moving back and forth between the two topics. This is because HTML is far more
                    interesting and much more fun to learn when you apply CSS, and you can't really learn CSS without
                    knowing HTML.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before starting this topic, you should also be familiar with using computers and using the web
                    passively (i.e., just looking at it, consuming the content). You should have a basic work
                    environment set up as detailed in Installing basic software and understand how to create and manage
                    files, as detailed in Dealing with files — both of which are parts of our Getting started with the
                    web complete beginner's module.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also recommended that you work through Getting started with the web before proceeding with
                    this topic, especially if you are completely new to web development. However, much of what is
                    covered in its CSS basics article is also covered in our CSS first steps module, albeit in a lot
                    more detail.

                </header>
                <p>
                    This topic contains the following modules, in a suggested order for working through them. You should
                    definitely start with the first one.
                </p>
                <h3>CSS first steps</h3>
                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example, to alter the font,
                    color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and
                    other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery
                    with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add
                    styling to HTML.
                </p>
                <pre>
          <code>
          style-rule ::=
          selectors-list {
            properties-list
          }
          </code>
          </pre>
                <h3>CSS building blocks</h3>
                <p>This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've gained familiarity with the
                    language and its syntax, and got some basic experience with using it, its time to dive a bit deeper.
                    This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units,
                    sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more.
                </p>
                <pre>
          <code>
          strong {
            color: red;
          }
          </code>
          </pre>
                <p>
                    The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all
                    the essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like text styling and CSS
                    layout.
                </p>
                <h3>Styling text</h3>
                <p>
                    With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling
                    text — one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals,
                    including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows and other text
                    features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling
                    lists and links.
                </p>
                <pre>
          <code>
          h2 {
            font-size: 2rem;
          }
          </code>
          </pre>
                <h3>CSS layout</h3>
                <p>At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and
                    manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes
                    in the right place in relation to the viewport, and one another. We have covered the necessary
                    prerequisites so we can now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, modern
                    layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques you might
                    still want to know about.
                </p>
                <pre>
          <code>
          #flex-container {
            display: flex;
            flex-direction: row;
          }
      </code>
      </pre>

                    <h2>Solving common CSS problems</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    Use CSS to solve common problems provides links to sections of content explaining how to use CSS to
                    solve very common problems when creating a web page.

                <p>
                    From the beginning, you'll primarily apply colors to HTML elements and their backgrounds; change the
                    size, shape, and position of elements; and add and define borders on elements. But there's not much
                    you can't do once you have a solid understanding of even the basics of CSS. One of the best things
                    about learning CSS is that once you know the fundamentals, usually you have a pretty good feel for
                    what can and can't be done, even if you don't actually know how to do it yet!
                </p>
                <pre>
          <code>
           nav {

           }
          </code>

                    The main entry point for CSS documentation on MDN, where you'll find detailed reference
                    documentation for all features of the CSS language. Want to know all the values a property can take?
                    This is a good place to go.
